# Wgpu Voxel Engine

This is a voxel engine made in Rust with wgpu-rs API.

Primary goal of this project is to make *procedural terrain generation* similar to Minecraft's terrain generation.

This repository was created with a goal to rewrite the old **[wgpu-beginner-project](https://github.com/Blatko1/wgpu-beginner-project)** for a better performance and cleaner code.
