A voxel engine made in Rust with wgpu-rs framework.

Primary goal of this project is to make *procedural terrain generation* similar to Minecraft's terrain generation.

**TODOs**:
- Add mipmapping
- Add debug menu 
- Add infinite chunk generation
- Add lightning
- Add frustum culling
- Divide chunks into bigger regions
- Add noise terrain generation
- Add some physics
